      <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
      <p>
        The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Chapter at the University of Florida (SHPE UF) was formerly known as the Hispanic Engineering Society. It was founded in the fall of 1982 in an effort to provide Hispanic Engineers,
        Mathematicians, and Scientists with opportunities to develop as professionals while offering an amiable social environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its inception it has prompted the recruitment, retention, and graduation of Hispanic students in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The society coordinates community outreach, corporate exposition
        meetings, academic development programs, and non-technical events. All this, to ensure SHPE UF members are presented with the opportunities necessary to succeed professionally, academically, and socially as Hispanic professionals.
      </p>
